# Architect

Sketch types, function signatures, class shapes, and module boundaries with `not implemented` bodies and pseudocode. Synthesize across multiple model perspectives, then fill in code against the chosen sketch.

## Spawning roster agents

This workflow runs on the repo's role agents (see "Agent roster and model routing" in CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md). Each agent file pins its model and effort, so never pass a model override.

- Claude Code: use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "<agent>"`. Put every parallel spawn in one message with `run_in_background: true`, then wait for the completion notifications instead of polling.
- Codex: spawn the custom agent by its name with the subagent tool offered in the current tool schema, and wait with the host's wait mechanism.
- If a named agent is not available, stop and tell the user to install the roster (`agent-roster` skill). Do not substitute a different agent or model.

## Start

Open a task list with the host's todo or plan tool, with one entry per phase, before starting.

1. Ground
2. Sketch
3. Agree
4. Implement
5. Scrap

## Phase A: Ground the problem

Build a real mental model of every system the new code touches. Run the **how** skill over the relevant subsystems. Naming a file isn't grounding. Produce the architectural explanation `how` prescribes. If the design redefines ownership or layering, also run the **why** skill on the existing shape so the rationale becomes a constraint, not a guess.

Skip Phase A only when the work is genuinely greenfield with no surrounding system to integrate.

## Phase B: Sketch

Run the **arena** skill with the design-sketch task and the Phase A grounding artifacts. Pass `references/runner-prompt.md` as each runner's prompt.

The arena runners are `architect-runner` and `architect-runner-cross` (a different model provider on purpose), in place of the arena's own runners. The arena judges (`arena-judge` and `arena-judge-cross`) cross-judge the candidates as usual. Each runner writes its sketch only inside its own git worktree, which you create with `git worktree add` (per the repo's or user's worktree convention when one exists) and pass via a `dir: <absolute worktree path>` line followed by a `---` line at the top of the runner's request.

Design it twice. Require at least two structurally distinct candidates before synthesis, even when the first looks sufficient. Whole-shape alternatives, not point fixes inside one shape.

Screen every candidate against [`references/design-red-flags.md`](references/design-red-flags.md) before synthesis. Assume the next contributor is an agent that sees only the files it opened, copies the nearest example, and takes the shortest path that compiles. Prefer the design where a change that looks right from one file is right for the whole repo.

Compare viable candidates on interface depth. Prefer the design that hides more complexity behind a smaller, simpler public surface. A rich interface can keep call chains short by concentrating capability instead of scattering it across layers.

Arena returns one synthesized design package. Its synthesis decision fills the rationale's "Synthesis decision" section.

## Phase C: Agree (opt-in)

Default: proceed directly to implementation with the synthesized design. No human checkpoint.

Opt in to a checkpoint when the invoker explicitly asks: "/architect with checkpoint," "stop and show me before implementing," or similar. Then surface the synthesized design and pause for sign-off.

The synthesis can ship as its own commit either way (scaffold first, then fill in). Planned and scoped breakage during fill-in is fine when it is declared up front and ends with the fill-in. For adversarial pressure on the design before implementing, run the **interrogate** skill on the synthesized sketch.

If the human pushes back on the shape (in a checkpoint or after the fact), treat that as Phase A evidence. Re-ground and re-run Phase B before writing more code.

## Phase D: Implement against the sketch

Replace `not implemented` bodies with code, pseudocode with logic. The synthesized sketch is the contract. Deviations from it are signal to surface, not friction to absorb silently. If a function needs a parameter the sketch didn't anticipate, ask whether the sketch was wrong, the requirement was missed, or the implementation is overreaching.

Delegate the implementation to `feature`, or to `hardest-tasks` when the work is cross-cutting or ambiguous. Hand it the synthesized sketch and rationale as the contract. Have `verifier` check the result against the sketch and the repo's tests.

## Phase E: Scrap when the architecture is wrong

If implementation keeps producing friction the sketch can't absorb, throw the sketch out. Don't bolt fixes onto a wrong design: fix the root cause and redesign from first principles.

The signal is a *pattern*, not single instances. Tells:

- The same shape of workaround appearing repeatedly across unrelated code.
- Multiple unrelated edge cases that all need special-case branches.
- Types that need escape hatches (`any`, casts, optional fields always set in practice) to compile.
- The "we need a lock" reflex when the sketch said the state wasn't shared.
- Callers having to know the abstraction's internal rules to use it.
- Two or more independent Phase D deviations of the same shape across the implementation.

Use judgment. A few edge cases don't condemn an architecture. Some problems are legitimately complex. Complexity in the data is not complexity in the design.

When you scrap:

1. Re-run the **how** skill over what's been built.
2. Redesign as if the new constraints had been day-one assumptions.
3. Subtract before adding. The new sketch should be smaller than the old one before it grows.
4. Return to Phase B and re-run arena.

## Outputs

The caller's usage is written first and the type sketch derived from it. One file with new types and signatures for small changes. Module map plus type definitions for larger work. The rationale ships alongside, shaped per `references/rationale-template.md`, including the usage sketch and the synthesis decision.

## Agents

- `architect-runner`: base-seat design-sketch runner in Phase B, writing only in its own worktree.
- `architect-runner-cross`: second-model-family design-sketch runner in Phase B; its disagreement is signal.
- `arena-judge`: cross-judges the sketch candidates in Phase B.
- `arena-judge-cross`: independent second-model-family judge of the sketch candidates in Phase B.
- `feature`: implements the agreed sketch in Phase D.
- `hardest-tasks`: implements in Phase D when the work is cross-cutting or ambiguous.
- `verifier`: checks the Phase D implementation against the sketch and tests.
